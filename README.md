# Petunia

A dead simple, file system-based, self-hosted pastebin service.
Written in [Deno](https://deno.land/) with [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) web framework.

### Getting Started

First, install Deno with [this link](https://deno.land/#installation).

Then, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~tsukii/petunia
```

`cd` to the project directory, then create the directory `junkdir` at the root directory.

Finally, start the project:

```
deno task start
```

Go to `localhost:8000` and you should see Petunia in action!
